    Setting up postgres database for your day-to-day dev activities is an easy task;
    you just need to download the installer and install it. It can be a little harder when you need more than one
    version on your local machine or when there is a new postgres release available.
</p>
<p>
    In this blog I am going to describe a much simpler approach for setting up postgres database in your local machine using
    docker.
</p>
<p>
    Disclaimer: This might not be the right place if you are looking  to setup your
    postgres instance on your production environment.
</p>

<h4>Prerequisite: Docker</h4>
<p>
    Installing docker on your machine is no longer a difficult task, especially, on latest windows 10.
    You can refer this <a href="https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-windows-10">link</a> for Windows 10 and
    <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04">link</a> for ubuntu.
</p>

<h4>Start docker command using a single command execution</h4>

<pre>
    <code>
    docker run --name postgres-dev -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -d postgres:latest
    </code>
</pre>
<p>Executing the above command will do two things if you don’t have postgres:version image on your docker.</p>
<p> 1. It will download the docker image. Downloading image will happen during the first execution of this command.
    This step will be skipped if the image is already available in your docker instance.

<p>2. Create a docker container with name</p>

</p>
<h4>Postgres Credentials</h4>
<p>
    As shown in the command postgres super user <b>password</b> is set using environmental variable
    <i>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</i>.
    This cannot be undefined or empty in the docker run command.
</p><p>
    <b>Username</b> can be specified by providing environment variable <i>POSTGRES_USER</i>, but if you are not
    specifying this
    variable, default username <i>'postgres'</i> will be used.
</p><p>
    <b>Port</b> is mapped using the -p option. In this case port 5432 of postgres container is mapped with your host
    machine’s
    same port. In case this port is already in use, you can point to a different port as
    shown below.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
    docker run --name postgres-dev -p your-available-port:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -d postgres:latest
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    The optional environment variable <i>POSTGRES_DB</i> can be used to define a different name for the database.
    If it is not specified, the value of <i>POSTGRES_USER</i> will be used as the database name.
    In this case, the database name will be <i>postgres</i>.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
    For development purposes, running postgres inside your docker machine is much more simpler.
    It is as simple as a single command line execution. This comes especially handy when you need to upgrade or downgrade your postgres setup.
